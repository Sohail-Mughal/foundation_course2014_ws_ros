===============================================
Fixing unresolved includes:

Add these environment variables:
ROS_ROOT
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
PYTHONPATH
PATH
ROS_MASTER_URI

In Eclipse, right click the project, click properties -> C/C++ general -> Preprocessor Include Paths, Macros etc. Click the tab "Providers" and check the box next to "CDT GCC Built-in Compiler Settings [ Shared ]".

Afterwards, right click the project, select Index -> Rebuild. This will rebuild your index. Once this is done, usually all includes will resolve.
