Installing stage from source:

Step 1: Open the terminal 

Step 2: Install prerequisites:

sudo apt-get install libltdl-dev

Step 3: Cloned this repository

git clone git@github.com:brsu-amr/stage.git

git clone https://github.com/brsu-amr/stage.git


Step 4: Navigate to the stage folder and execute these commands

mkdir build && cd build

cmake ~DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/hydro ..

make

sudo make install
	Note: The execution of this command will print installation directories on the terminal. 
	Scroll up and look for the location of the these files:
		stage.hh (for example, /usr/local/include/Stage-4.1 or /opt/ros/hydro)
		libstage.so (for example, /usr/local/lib/ or /opt/ros/hydro/lib)
		libstage.so.4.1.1 (for example, /usr/local/lib/ or /opt/ros/hydro/lib)

Step 5: Now the stage is Installed in /usr/local or /opt/ros/hydro in Stage-4.1. 

Step 6: Now Execute the following commands. 
If your operating system is 32-bit then you need not to execute these commands. 

sudo rm /usr/local/lib/libstage.so 
sudo rm /usr/local/lib/libstage.so.4.1.1
sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib64/libstage.so.4.1.1 /usr/local/lib/libstage.so 
sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib64/libstage.so.4.1.1 /usr/local/lib/libstage.so.4.1.1

Now you are ready to run stage.

Change the location path of the stage.hh, libstage.so and libstage.so.4.1.1 and compile. 

If the error comes no rule to make file ...... libstage.so .........

Then delete your build and devel folder and again compile. Now it should work.

cheers :-)
