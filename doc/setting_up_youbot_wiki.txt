Hands on real youbot arm

Pre-requisites:
    If the pre-requisites are already completed then you can directly go to step 3.

Step 1: ROS-hydro must be already installed.

Step 2: ROS workspace should be setup. 
    Give suitable name to ROS workspace root directory. e.g. foundation@course_ws
    Set up the default environment variable. Source them in bashrc script.

If everything is fine then go ahead and follow the next steps. 

Step 3: 
    Clone required repositories for youbot into source directory(foundation@course_ws/src/) 
    of your ROS workspace or create a direcory(e.g. youbot-control) in source 
    directory  and clone inside there.

        git@github.com:mas-group/youbot_description.git
        git@github.com:mas-group/youbot_driver_ros_interface.git
        git@github.com:mas-group/youbot_driver.git

        or if someone still have problem with ssh keys then clone using these:

        https://github.com/mas-group/youbot_description.git
        https://github.com/mas-group/youbot_driver_ros_interface.git
        https://github.com/mas-group/youbot_driver.git

Step 4: 
    After cloning, navigate to root directory of your workspace and compile.

        roscd && cd ..

        catkin_make

    Note: During compilation a window will popup that will ask for password to enter.
    Then you need to enter your sudo password.

Step 5: 
    If you are only connecting with real arm then you need to do changes in two files.

    First edit the youbot-manipulator.cfg:
        Navigate to /youbot_driver/config/ from command line.

            roscd youbot_driver/config/

        and edit:

            nano youbot-manipulator.cfg

        change the sequence number of the joints. After editing joint sequence look like this:

            ManipulatorJoint1 = 1
            ManipulatorJoint2 = 2
            ManipulatorJoint3 = 3
            ManipulatorJoint4 = 4
            ManipulatorJoint5 = 5

    Secondly, edit youbot_driver.launch:

        Naviage to youbot_driver_ros_interface/launch/ from command line.

            roscd youbot_driver_ros_interface/launch/

        and edit:

            nano youbot_driver.launch

        and change the youBotHasBase parameter value to false. After editing, the line should look like this:

            <param name="youBotHasBase" type="bool" value="false"/>

Steps 6 and 7 needs to be done with real youbot.

Step 6: 
    Connect youbot arm with your pc/laptop using ethernet connection.
    Connect power to the arm. 
    The arm switch on/off button light will become red. 
    Press this button to power the motors.The light will become green.
        Caution: Do not move the joints of the arm manually when the light is green otherwise the joint can broke.
    Connect an ethernet cable between arm and your pc/laptop.
        Configure your ethernet IP address manully and give some constant IP address.e.g.
            IP: 192.168.0.1 , SubnetMask: 255.255.255.0

        Now connect with the ethernet.

Step 7: 
    Prepare to bringup youbot arm.
        Open the terminal.Execute the following command.
            roslaunch youbot_driver_ros_interface youbot_driver.launch

            Note: this command will initilize the arm and rotate all joints to zero position. 
            If you get error related to joint x can not be initilized. Then turn off the arm by 
            pressing switch on/off button and rotate the arm joints manually. It is recommended to rotate the joints near to zero position to initilize faster before switching
            on the arm.

        if everything goes well with the launch, then you are ready to control the arm joints.

Cheers :-)
